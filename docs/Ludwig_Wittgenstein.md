# Ludwig Wittgenstein
There is a clear distinction between early and late phases in Wittgenstein’s theory. The distinction is a dramatic shift in his philosophical approaches regarding language, logic, and metaphysics. Early Wittgenstein, exemplified in his *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*, held that philosophical problems are the result of language misunderstanding. His early theory argues that language mirrors reality through logical structures, which is termed as the "picture theory" of meaning. He believed that the proper analysis of language could resolve all philosophical problems by clarifying what can be meaningfully said. However, the Late Wittgenstein, as seen in *Philosophical Investigations*, abandoned the approach above. He critiqued his earlier work and argued that meaning is not a function of logical structure but is dependent on the use of words in specific contexts, which he called "language games." This later view emphasizes the fluid, social, and practical aspects of language. 

## Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus
### The Picture Theory of Language [metaphysics] [phil_of_language]
The picture theory argues that propositions are meaningful if and only if they represent states of affairs in the world. These states are empirical and can be represented by logical structures. As a photograph represents a scene by demonstrating its structure, language represents facts by showing their logical form. For Wittgenstein’s theory, a meaningful proposition must mirror the reality it describes. This requires the components of a proposition to correspond to objects in the world, and the relationships between components in a proposition correspond to the relationships between the objects in the real world. For example, the sentence “The tree is tall” can be meaningful as the word “the tree” corresponds to an object, and “is tall” describes the relation of the tree to the world. This logical structure makes the proposition to have truth value which depends on whether the facts the proposition depicts are the case in the world.

### The Structure of Reality [metaphysics]
According to Wittgenstein, the world is not made up of individual objects in isolation, but rather facts, which are combinations of objects in specific ways. This is different from thinking of reality as just a collection of individual entities. Instead, Wittgesntein's thoery suggests that we should think of reality in terms of relationships and structures.

A fact has logical structure as it is composed of objects arranged in particular ways, and this structure can be mirrored by language. For example, a sentence like “The cat is on the mat” reflects the relation ‘being on top of’ between the object ‘the cat’ and ‘the mat’.

An object is the building blocks of reality. It is simple and indestructible. Objects by themselves do not have any meaning nor make up our world. They are meaningful only when they are combined in certain relations. Meanwhile, there are some internal properties within objects so that there are constraints and on the way of the object combinations. For example, a cat can be on a mat, but it cannot be on air.

### The limits of language and ladder metaphor [metaphysics] [phil_of_language]
Wittgenstein famously asserts that “the limits of my language mean the limits of my world.” The reason is that language can only meaningfully discuss what is logically structured and contains truth value. Anything outside the realm of facts then falls into the domain of nonsensical or what cannot be said, such as ethics, aesthetics, or metaphysics. This is because they are not logically structured propositions about facts and are therefore meaningless. For example, statement “We should act justly” is about the question of how we ought to live instead of what is. And “God exists” is not a fact that can be empirically verified.

However, it is not to say that ethics and metaphysics do not exist– they are merely not logically constructed. While language can say facts about the world, it can also show something deeper. For example, logic itself cannot be stated meaningfully in the same way as empirical facts, but logical structure is inherently shown in language. The sentence “The cat is on the mat and is not on the mat” says the cat, as an object, is in a relation with an object, i.e. the mat, and the relation is “to be on the top of” and “to be not on the top of.” While this sentence shows contradiction, what it says is the objects and relations.

As *Tractatus* is a book touching on metaphysical and logical discussions, the propositions made in this books are nonetheless within the limit of language. To this paradox, Wittgenstein uses the ladder metaphor to suggest that once the reader understands the structure and limits of language, the content in *Tractatus* then becomes nonsensical. This process is like a climbing on a ladder: each step on the ladder corresponds to the reader’s increasing understanding of language and its limits. The reader is climbing towards to the true understanding. And once the reader udnerstands, they no longer need the contents that helped them get there. The book of *Tractatus* themselves become useless or nonsensical because they were meant to be tools to reveal the nature of language. 

## Philosophy as Clarification
In *Tractus*, Wittgenstein argues that philosophy’s role is not to discover new facts about the world but to clarify what can be meaningfully said. He believes that many traditional philosophical problems arise out of the confusion of language, where people try to say about things that cannot be said, such as ethics and metaphysics. Thus, philosophy, by Witggenstein, is an activity of clarifying language and getting rid of pseudo-problems where people focus on nonsensical propositions.  

*Late Wittgenstein*
## Transition from Early to Late
Wittgenstein’s later philosophy, primarily stated in *Philosophical Invesitgations*, is characterized by a preference for a more fluid approach to philosophy. Wittgenstein turns to the complexity of daily language usage.

## Language-Games and Meaning as Use [Phil_of_language]
Wittgenstein emphasizes how words gain their meaning through their use in particular contexts, which he calls language games. These games are not rigidly defined systems of rules and definitions but flexible activities that vary through out the context. Meaning is fluid and determined by the practical activities. There is not an abstract essential meaning of a word but a family resemblance among different uses of the word. As members of a family may share certain characteristics without all having one identical feature, the meaning of a word can overlap throughout contexts without being reducible to a single definition.

As the meaning is highly fluid, Wittgenstein argues that the meaning of a word is its use in the language. And this is very different from his earlier argument of meaning as a reference to things in real world. Instead, language cannot be understood in the insolation from the form of life. The form of life, as Wittgenstein uses, is the complex of human activities, including traditions, cultural practices, and everyday interactions. And the meaning of words depends on the shared practices and values of the people who use them. 

## Rule-Following and Private Language Argument [Phil_of_language]
Since language is so deeply rooted in interactions and context, Wittgenstein argues that language is inherently public. Instead of formed privately in one’s mind, the meaning of expressions is negotiated and understood through public rules and social practices. For example, the meaning of traffic lights depends on the shared understanding in a given society.

And this argument leads Wittgenstein to  present the private language argument: language that refers solely to an individual’s private sensation is impossible because there would be no way to establish the meaning of the words. For an expression to be meaningful, there must be rules for its use, rules that emerge from the common practices within a community. 

## Philosophy as Therapy [Phil_of_language]
Late Wittgenstein’s view of philosophy still focuses on the clarification of language use, but in a very different way. Wittgenstein believes that many traditional philosophical problems, such as the nature of reality, consciousness, or ethics, are not genuine problems that require theories to solve. Instead, they are confusions caused by the misuse of language. For Wittgenstein, these confusions occur when we take language out of its ordinary context and try to apply it in inappropriate ways. And the task for philosophers, then, is not to develop new theories but to engage in a process of clarification of languages’ daily use and revealing how the confusion arises.

And this strategy is called dissolving the problem, instead of solving it. As philosophical problems are conceptual confusions rather than actual questions about the world, philosophers can reveal the confusion by recognizing how the language games play on meaning. Like a therapist helps patients overcome personal anxieties by clarifying their misunderstandings, philosophers help to dissolve philosophical problems by showing how languages are misused and painting out the proper ways in which it functions. 
	
To illustrate the task of philosophers, Wittgenstein made a metaphor of a fly trapped in a bottle: philosophers are like a fly caught in a bottle, where the bottle represents the symbolization of the constraint of language. And the task for philosophers is to show the way out of the bottle, and the way to do that is to dissolve the misunderstandings that trap us instead of to do further theoretical investigation. For example, the question “What is consciousness” arises because we mistakenly treat mental phenomena as they were something outside of language, like an entity to be defined. Instead, a better way to check this question is to look at how we talk about being conscious or unconscious in different usage. For instance, in daily life, we may say “I am conscious of the noise.” And this use of “consciousness” does not require us to take consciousness as an abstract entity but merely reflects how we talk about it. The meaning of “consciousness” is rooted in its use in context, instead of its definition as an abstract entity.

## Arrow to [The Vienna Circle] ("Influence")
The Vienna Circle's theory of meaning was influenced by Ludwig Wittgenstein’s early work. Wittgenstein argued that the function of language is to represent facts about the world. For a statement to be meaningful, it must have a clear connection to a possible state of affairs in the world. Wittgenstein’s dictum, “The sense of a proposition is its method of verification,” became a guiding principle for the Vienna Circle.

## Arrow to [Ordinary Language Philosophy] ("Influence")
Wittgenstein is often considered one of the central figures of Ordinary Language Philosophy, particularly due to his later works. His emphasis on the analysis of languages’ daily usage,  clarification of misunderstanding, and attention to context was widely taken by philosophers in the Oridinary Language Philosophy movements.
