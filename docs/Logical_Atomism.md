# Logical Atomism
Logical atomism is a viewpoint developed by [Bertrand Russell](link in our site) and [Ludwig Wittgenstein](link in our site) claiming that the world is composed of independently existing entities that exhibit qualities and stand in relations. These entities, known as atomic facts, can be either simple particulars with qualities or multiple simple particulars in relations. Meanwhile, logical atomism emphasizes the importance of logical analysis, as complex notions and vocabularies are understood in terms of simpler ones. The process of analysis is necessary in the understanding of propositions and the nature of reality. Ultimately the process of analysis reveals that what may appear to be necessities are actually logical in nature.
