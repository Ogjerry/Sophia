# Rudolf Carnap
## Theory Framework and Inductive Logic [Philosophy_of_Science]
In his investigation in philosophy of science, Carnap tackled with two questions: 1) how scientific theories can be confirmed through observation, and 2) how their empirical content can be assessed.

A key strategy in Carnap’s theory is his Principle of Tolerance, which argues that there is no single, correct logical framework. Instead, there can be multiple valid systems of logic, each suited for different purposes. For example, scientists can shift between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics without assuming that one is inherently superior than other. The choice of framework is based on what works best for the task at hand.

With the lens of the principle of tolerance, Carnap argues that scientific statements, essentially speaking, could only be confirmed to certain degrees of probability rather than a conclusive certification. Moreover, Crnap distinguished two types of probability: 1. Relative Frequency: the empirical probability of any event. This is what we typically think of in terms of statistical probabilities, and 2. Epistemic Probability: an individual’s degree of certainty about the truth of a statement. Carnap’s focus was on the measurement of epistemic probability, which comes up as a standard to determine validity of scientific theories. 

To achieve the goal of measuring epistemic probability, Carnap looks at induction, where people draw conclusions from observed data, as a crucial part of science, and he develops a set of inductive logic. Carnap argues that by assigning numerical probabilities to a hypothesis, we can quantify scientific confirmation. In this sense, scientists could adjust their confidence in a theory as new evidence comes up. 

## The *Aufbau* project [Philosophy_of_Science] [Epistemology]
Carnap’s The Logical Construction of the World (known as the Aufbau) was a work where Carnap seeks to systematically construct all knowledge within a deductive framework.
In the Aufbau, Carnap adopted a strictly extensional approach: he only focused on the meaning that are based solely on observable relations and constructions without appeal to subjective or intensional language. This strict extensionalism reinforced Carnap's goal of building a formal system that minimized psychological aspects, ensuring concepts were built from observable relations that could be logically analyzed​.
To analyze objective experiences, Carnap proposes to use the “elementary experience” (or “time-slices” of experience) as the foundational unit of knowledge. By recognizing similarities in those elementary experiences, we come up with structured classes. This method takes knowledge as the relation among sensory experiences, such as colors or sounds.

## The Raod to Syntax
Still aiming to systematically construct knowledge, Carnap was focused on the development of a purely syntactical language for scientific investigation in The Road to Road. The idea is to create a universal, formal mode of expression for science. Carnap tries to represent logical structure through simple symbols, like dot patterns, which reflect basic arithmetic rules.
One feature of Carnpa’s logical structure is that it is devoid of meaning. Instead, Carnap insists in the idea that so called meaningful statements must either directly relate to empirical observations or can be translated into logical forms. This feature aligns with the physcialism within Vienna Circle that all knowledge are reducible interms of physics.
