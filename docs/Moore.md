## The Refutation of Idealism and the proof of the external world [ontology]

Against the Idealist notion that to be is to be perceived, the central idea of Moore´s counterargument is that external objects are things whose existence is not dependent upon our experience. This is the distinction of consciousness and the content of our consciousness. To prove their existence, Moore holds up his two hands and states, "Here is one hand" while making a gesture with his right hand, and then adds, " and here is another" while making a gesture with his left hand. He argues that this simple demonstration provides a perfectly rigorous proof of the existence of external objects. Moore's aim is to establish the existence of an external world, rather than proving his knowledge of it. 

## Principia Ethica [ethics]

Anti-naturalistic view: In Principia Ethica, G.E. Moore introduces the famous "naturalistic fallacy," which states that it is a mistake to define goodness in terms of natural properties such as pleasure or desire. In this sense, goodness is an indefinable and irreducible concept. Moore holds the view that ethical questions cannot be answered solely by appealing to natural facts or _scientific_ knowledge.

Consequentialist account of ethics:  the right action is determined by its ability to produce the best outcome. The ultimate goal of ethics, Moore argued, is to maximize intrinsic value <sup>1</sup>, which is the fundamental type of ethical value.

## Analysis [epistemology]

According to Moore, analysis is an important method of philosophical study. In his use of analysis, Moore focuses on identifying the subjects and properties involved in propositions. He believes that analyzing propositions can reveal their ontological implications and help us understand what is at stake in philosophical debates.

## Perception and Sense-data [epistemology] [ontology]

Moore suggested three kinds of relation between our perception and sense data<sup>2</sup>: indirect realism, phenomenalism, and direct realism. Indirect realism suggests that sense-data are non-physical but produced by interactions between physical objects and our senses. Phenomenalism posits that our conception of physical objects is based on observed and anticipated uniformities among sense data. Direct realism, on the other hand, suggests that sense data are parts of physical objects. Moore adopts a direct realist position, which suggests that sense-data are physical objects.

## Footnotes

1. The distinction between <span style = "text-decoration: underline;"> intrinsic value</span> and <span style = "text-decoration: underline;"> instrumental value</span>: According to Moore, intrinsic value is the value inherent in a situation, independent of its consequences. Friendship, for instance, can be regarded as possessing intrinsic value since it is desirable itself for no further reason. Moore distinguishes intrinsic value from instrumental value, which depends on the situation's consequences. If exchanging gift, for example, is helpful to enhance friendship, it has instrumental value. While instrumental value can be defined in terms of the intrinsic value of a situation's consequences, intrinsic value remains the fundamental conception of value.

2. Moore introduces the concept of sense-data as the primary objects of experience, describing them as the color, shape, and size that we perceive directly.
