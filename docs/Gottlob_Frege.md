# Gottlob Frege

## I. Logic Language [philosophy_of_language]

Frege thinks one can prove every logical truth based on a limited number of logical axioms by deduction. And this task cannot be done by natural language. Thus, Frege proposed a set of logically clear language in which logical relations are unambiguous.

Frege defines a concept as a function with a truth value, either the True or the False. For instances, the concept being animal is a function with True as the truth value for any argument that is animal. Suppose “A()” stands for that concept, and “d” is a constant for dogs, and “b” is a constant for the city of Boston. Then “A(d)” stands for the True, while “A(b)” stands for the False. Frege also created signs for negation and conditional. For Frege, the conditional function, “$\rightarrow$” is understood as a function the value of which is the False if its first argument is the True and the second argument is anything other than the True, and is the True otherwise. Therefore, “A(b) $\rightarrow$ A(a)” stands for the True, while “A(d) $\rightarrow$ H(b)” stands for the False. The negation sign “$\sim$” stands for a function whose value is the True for every argument except the True, for which its value is the False. 

To express generality, Frege introduced the use of quantifiers. The Universal Quantifier “$\forall$x(…x…)” can be translated to English as “For all x, x…” For instance, $\forall$xA(x) means “For all x, x is animal.” Meanwhile, the Existential Quantifier “$\exists$x(…x…)” can be translated to English as “There is an x that x …” For instance, $\exists$xA(x) means “There is an x that x is animal.”

## II. Philosophy of Mathematics[ontology]

Frege was an advocate of logicism, the idea that arithmetic truths are logical truths. That’s why he strongly criticized psychologism, which ties logic and mathematics to psychological states, and emphasized that mathematical truths are objective. He also opposed John Stuart Mill’s empirical view of arithmetic, arguing that numbers are not merely collections of objects and that mathematical truths are knowable a priori.

Frege’s observed that numbers often indicate how many times a concept is instantiated, e.g., “I have six cards” indicates the concept of being a card is instantiated six times. This led to defining numbers as second-level concepts, or concepts about concepts, which can be expressed logically using quantifiers and identity. He then further extended this definition by treating numbers as value-ranges (which is essentially extension of concepts) of value-ranges. In this system, natural numbers are a relation where two value-ranges are equal if there is a one-to-one correspondence between their members. Zero was defined as the value-range of all empty value-ranges, one as the value-range of all value-ranges equal in size to the value-range of being identical to zero, and so forth. Each natural number was defined in terms of its predecessor, leading to the concept of infinity and the validity of mathematical induction.

Despite his groundbreaking work, Frege’s logicism faced challenges. Russell’s paradox undermined his logical treatment of value-ranges, and Gödel’s incompleteness theorem later showed that no finite system can derive all truths, challenging ambitious forms of logicism. Nonetheless, Frege’s contributions to mathematical logic and the philosophy of mathematics remain significant and influential.

## III. Sense and Reference [philosophy_of_language] [ontology]

Gottlob Frege's theory of meaning is mainly focused on the distinction between **sense** and **reference**. Think of an equation “4 x 2 = 11 - 3”. While the “=” sign denotes a strict identity, expressions  "4 x 2" and "11 - 3" refer to the same number (eight “8”) but present it differently. Thus, Frege demarcated the difference between the reference (the actual entity, like the number eight) and the sense (the way the entity is presented).

Of course, this distinction is beyond mathematical expressions and applicable to all linguistic expressions, including natural and formal languages. Frege illustrated this point with the expressions "the morning star" and "the evening star," both referring to the planet Venus but presenting it differently. Here, the reference is Venus, while the sense involves the different properties.

Frege used this distinction to address puzzles concerning identity claims, such as:

> The morning star = the morning star.

> The morning star = the evening star.

The first is a trivial identity, while the second seems informative. Frege explained that while the references are the same (Venus), the senses differ, making the second statement informative despite both involving the same identity.

Frege extended his sense/reference distinction to logical propositions. The reference of a proposition is its truth value (True or False), while its sense is the thought or cognitive content it expresses. For example, "2 + 4 = 6" and "the Earth rotates" both have the reference True, but their senses differ. Frege's view implies that the sense of a proposition determines how its truth value is understood.

Besides complete expressions, Frege applied the sense/reference distinction to incomplete expressions like functional expressions and grammatical predicates. These incomplete expressions, such as "the square root of ( )" or "( ) is a planet," refer to functions needing arguments to yield values. For instance, "the square root of ( )" refers to a function mapping numbers to their square roots. Similarly, predicates like "( ) is a planet" refer to functions mapping objects to truth values (True for planets like Venus, False for non-planets).

Frege viewed senses and references as objective, existing in a timeless "third realm" independent of language and individual minds. These abstract entities can be shared and communicated, with their existence and truth values unaffected by whether they are thought or expressed.

## Arrow to [Leibniz] ("Discussion")

Frege tackled issues with Leibniz's law of identity, which states that identical things can be substituted without changing truth values. For example:

> (1) The morning star is a planet.
> (2) The evening star is a planet.

If "the morning star" and "the evening star" have the same reference, substituting one for the other should preserve truth. However, in belief contexts:

> (3) Gottlob believes that the morning star is a planet.
> (4) Gottlob believes that the evening star is a planet.

If Gottlob doesn't know they're the same, (3) and (4) can differ in truth. Frege solved this by distinguishing <span style = "text-decoration: underline;">primary <span>and <span style = "text-decoration: underline;">secondary<span> references. In indirect speech, the reference of an expression is its usual sense. Hence, in (3) and (4), the references of "the morning star" and "the evening star" are their senses, allowing different truth values.
