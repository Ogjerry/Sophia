## Critique of Cartesian Dualism [phil_of_mind]

Sellars’ critique of Cartesian dualism is targeting at the view that mental states are private, self-intimating, and fundamentally separate from the physical world. Descartes famously argued that introspection offers infallible access to our mental states, granting individuals a unique First-Person Authority over their thoughts and sensations. Sellars denies this characterization, arguing instead that mental states are not foundationally given or self-evident. For Sellars, thoughts and sensations are better understood as theoretical constructs, analogous to the unobservable entities postulated in scientific theories to explain observable phenomena. By treating mental states as explanatory tools rather than primary data, Sellars shifts the focus away from introspection as the ultimate source of knowledge.

In this reorientation, Sellars draws a sharp distinction between intentional and sensory episodes. Intentional episodes—such as beliefs, desires, and hopes—are marked by their "aboutness," meaning they inherently refer to something external to themselves. Sensory episodes, on the other hand, encompass the qualitative, felt aspects of experience, such as the warmth of a fire or the sight of a red patch. This distinction challenges the Cartesian notion of a unified mental realm where all mental occurrences are forms of "thinking." Sellars emphasizes that intentionality, rather than being an intrinsic property of the mind, arises through linguistic practices and normative structures. Mental states gain their coherence and content through participation in the "logical space of reasons," a shared, language-dependent framework where meaning and justification are inseparable.

This perspective undermines the Cartesian premise that mental states are self-contained and directly accessible. Instead, Sellars positions them as deeply interwoven with linguistic and social practices, requiring a communal and conceptual foundation for their intelligibility. By reframing mental states in this way, Sellars advances a naturalistic and functionally coherent theory of mind.

## Shifting from Foundationalism to Coherentism [Epistemology]

Foundationalism, the view that knowledge is hierarchically structured on a base of self-evident, epistemically independent truths, is a primary target of Sellars' argument. He famously argued that no cognitive state can satisfy the dual requirements foundationalism imposes: being both epistemically independent and epistemically efficacious. For a state to be epistemically independent, it must possess a positive epistemic status (such as justification or reliability) that does not depend on other states. For a state to be epistemically efficacious, it must be capable of supporting and justifying other cognitive states. Sellars demonstrates that these requirements are incompatible, as states that are epistemically independent lack the relational qualities necessary to justify others, while states that are efficacious inevitably derive their status from their connections to a broader system of knowledge.

Sellars’ rejection of foundationalism leads to his endorsement of a coherentist epistemology. He conceptualizes knowledge not as a structure built on indubitable foundations but as a web of interrelated and normatively governed states. Within this framework, knowledge is sustained by its coherence within a system of beliefs, where justification arises from the mutual support and alignment of cognitive states rather than from a privileged foundational base. Central to this view is what Sellars terms the "logical space of reasons," a domain where beliefs are assessed in terms of their rational relationships, including justification, inference, and coherence.

The logical space of reasons is essential for understanding cognition in Sellars’ epistemology. It emphasizes the normative dimensions of knowledge, where cognitive states are not merely causal responses to stimuli but are embedded in a network of reasons that guide their use, justification, and interrelation. This normative framework challenges the notion that knowledge can be reduced to naturalistic or empirical terms alone, asserting that epistemic justification inherently involves standards of correctness and rationality that transcend mere causality.

## The emphasis on the functional and referential role of meaning [Phil_of_lang]

Sellars refines traditional approaches to semantics by emphasizing the functional and inferential nature of meaning. Rejecting simplistic correspondence theories, Sellars focuses on the roles that linguistic expressions play within broader systems of communication and reasoning. His contributions to semantics highlight the normative and pragmatic dimensions of language, aligning with his broader commitment to integrating naturalism with the conceptual structures of human cognition.

On Functionalist Semantics, Sellars argues that meaning is not a static property tied to words and objects but a dynamic feature of linguistic use within specific contexts. According to this functionalist view, linguistic expressions derive their meaning from the roles they play in shared practices of communication. For example, the statement “‘Rot’ in German means red” reflects the equivalence of function between the German word “Rot” and the English word “red” in their respective languages.

To formalize this perspective, Sellars introduces the concept of dot-quotation to describe functional equivalence. Dot-quotation allows for statements such as “‘Rot’ in German is a •red•” to represent that “Rot” serves the same linguistic function as “red.” This analysis situates meaning within the normative framework of linguistic practices, emphasizing use and role over any direct correspondence to objects.

Expanding on his functionalist insights, Sellars highlights the inferential structure of meaning. He argues that understanding an expression involves grasping its role in a network of material inferences—relationships between statements that reflect their logical and normative connections. For instance, the statement “This is red” implies “This is colored.” These material inferences are not merely syntactic but reflect deeper conceptual relationships that govern the use of language.

Sellars’ inferentialist semantics directly challenges correspondence theories of truth, which posit a one-to-one relationship between language and reality. Instead, he proposes a pragmatic conception of truth, defining truth as the correct assertibility of a statement within the rules of a given language and the relevant context. This view shifts the focus from external metaphysical correspondences to the normative and functional criteria that guide linguistic practices.

## Addressing the relation between abstract entities and lingusitic practices [Ontology]

Sellars adopts a nominalist position, rejecting the existence of abstract entities as independent metaphysical realities. Instead, he interprets abstract terms, such as properties and propositions, as shorthand for linguistic functions. For Sellars, abstract language serves a practical role, enabling us to articulate rules, relationships, and normative structures without committing to the existence of Platonic forms or universals. For example, when we talk about “triangularity,” we are not referencing a metaphysically real property but rather engaging in a functional classification tied to linguistic usage.

This pragmatic approach challenges Platonism by reframing predication as a linguistic practice rather than a metaphysical relation. Sellars argues that predication involves the organization and qualification of terms to suit specific linguistic purposes, not the assertion of a direct relationship between objects and abstract entities. By situating abstract terms within the material mode of linguistic analysis, Sellars shifts the focus of metaphysics from ontological commitments to the pragmatic and functional roles of language in human understanding.

### The distinciton between The Manifest and Scientific Images

Sellars’ distinction between the manifest image and the scientific image is one of his most influential contributions to metaphysics. The manifest image is the normative and conceptual framework through which humans ordinarily experience and interpret the world. It is centered on persons and things, emphasizing reason, normativity, and the lived experience of acting for reasons. This image captures the human perspective as we encounter and make sense of the world in daily life.

In contrast, the scientific image is a postulated framework aimed at explaining reality through empirical investigation and theoretical modeling. It describes the world in terms of imperceptible entities such as subatomic particles, fields, and other scientific constructs. The scientific image seeks to provide a complete and objective explanation of the world, often in terms that differ dramatically from the manifest image.

Sellars contends that these two images are not entirely separate but interdependent. The manifest image provides the normative and conceptual foundations from which scientific inquiry emerges, while the scientific image offers a deeper, more comprehensive account of reality. However, the scientific image often appears to challenge the manifest image by portraying it as a mere approximation of reality.

To resolve this tension, Sellars advocates for a synoptic vision—a unification of the two images. He suggests that the manifest image, with its emphasis on normativity and human practices, and the scientific image, with its empirical and theoretical rigor, must be reconciled to provide a holistic understanding of the world. This synoptic vision does not reduce one image to the other but integrates their insights, preserving the normative structures of human life while accommodating the explanatory power of science.

## Arrow to [Bertrand_Russell] ("Objection")

Sellars’ understanding of meaning challenges Russell's theory of meaning by rejecting the idea that linguistic expressions primarily function through direct correspondence with objects or states of the world. Russell's emphasis on the referential relationship between language and reality assumes that meaning is grounded in a direct, descriptive connection to specific entities. In contrast, Sellars argues that meaning arises from the functional roles expressions play within linguistic practices and their inferential relationships to other expressions. This shift undermines Russell’s framework by prioritizing the normative and pragmatic dimensions of language over simple correspondence, thereby situating meaning within the broader context of communal, rule-governed linguistic activity.

## Arrow to [Gottlob_Frege] ("Resonation")

Sellars’ theory resonates with Frege’s one in their shared emphasis on the inferential and normative aspects of meaning. Both of them reject simplistic referential theories, instead focusing on how meaning is determined by the role of expressions within a broader linguistic or logical system. Frege’s distinction between sense and reference highlights that meaning involves not just direct correspondence to objects but also the conceptual framework through which those objects are apprehended. Similarly, Sellars underlines that meaning arises from the functional roles expressions play within networks of material inferences, such as the transition from “This is red” to “This is colored.” Additionally, both philosophers stress the normativity of language, with Frege treating logic as a normative science and Sellars extending normativity to semantics, arguing that meaning depends on rule-governed linguistic practices within a community. While Frege views thought as primary and language as its vehicle, Sellars inverts this relationship by treating thought as deriving its structure and intelligibility from public linguistic practices, placing greater emphasis on the social foundations of meaning. Despite this distinction, their work aligns in framing meaning as deeply conceptual and inferential rather than merely referential.
