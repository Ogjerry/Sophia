# P. F. Strawson 
## Theory on Truth [philosophy_of_language]
Strawson emphasized that when we make truth claims, we are not talking about the statement’s relation to its reference. Instead, it is a form of communication that signals acceptance of what is said. In other words, using "true" is part of the way we communicate and affirm our claims. It is an act that signals to others that we stand by what we are saying.  For example, if someone says, "It is true that Paris is the capital of France," they are not adding new information beyond simply stating, "Paris is the capital of France." The phrase "it is true" functions as an endorsement, confirming that the statement is accurate without invoking a new object called a "fact" or a reliance on linguistic rules to prove its truth.

## An Introduction to Logical Theory [logics]
In An Introduction to Logical Theory, Strawson aims to bridge the gap between the formal logic and the way language is used in everyday life. The book includes an analysis of some key logical concepts:

**Entailment**
With the emphasis on entailment as the fundamental aspect of logic, Strawson suggests that statements can logically entail others if denying the entailed statement while accepting the original results ina contradiction. For example, if “P” emtails “Q”, then “P and not Q” would be contradictory.

**Self-Contradiction**
Strawson explains contradictions as statements that essentially “cancel themselves out,” suggesting nothing coherent. 

Then, in Strawson’s analysis of the difference between formal logic and ordinary language, he points out that formal logic, used by philosophers and theorists, does not always align with daily use of language. And this difference is embodied in various aspects:

Truth-Functional Connectives: 
In formal logic, connectives like "and," "or," and "if...then..." (represented as logical symbols ∧, ∨, →) are defined by precise truth conditions. For instance, "P and Q" (P ∧ Q) is true only when both P and Q are true. Strawson observes that these formal definitions do not reflect the subtleties of how these connections are used in natural language. For example, the phrase “or” in ordinary language can be exclusive (this or that, but not both) or inclusive (this or that, or both), whereas in formal logic, it is typically deemed as inclusive. 

Precise logic:
Strawson argued that ordinary language connectives often convey meanings that go beyond truth-functional logic. For example, when we say, "He didn't go to the meeting because he was sick," we imply causation that formal logic does not capture with its simple use of "because." Strawson also suggests that ordinary language expressions do not always fit into the binary true/false structure that formal logic uses. Formal logic overlooks many features in everyday language including nuances, context, and presuppositions that formal logic overlooks.


## *Individuals* [Metaphysics]
In his work Individuals*, Strawson distinguishes *descriptive metaphysics* and *revisionary metaphysics*. 

Descriptive metaphysics is the approach of describing the basic, foundational structures of our thought and cognition. Strawson holds that there exists a core set of concepts embedded in human thinking that remain constant and form the basis of our experience of reality. The idea is that these concepts—such as those related to space and time—are universal and deeply ingrained in the way we understand the world. 

On the other hand, Revisionary Metaphysics is the approach of proposing new systems that could challenge our conventional understanding.

Strawson argued that descriptive metaphysics is better aligned with how humans naturally think and experience the world. 

## Perception and Language [epistemology] [philosophy_of_mind]
Strawson suggested an alternative to empiricism at his time. Empiricists like Locke and Hume argue that perception involves the mind receiving sensory impressions, which are further processed to form internal representations of the world. These representations were seen as detached from the external world. And this leaves the question of whether these representations are genuine open.

Strawson argued against this skepticist tendency by emphasizing that perception should be understood as causally connected to the external world. According to Strawson, when we perceive something, there is a direct causal link between the object in the world and our sensory experience. This view helps ground perception in reality. And it guarantees that our experiences reliably inform us about the world.

Another point Strawson tackled is the assumption of sense-data as intermediaries between the external world and the perceiver’s mind. Strawson rejected the need for sense data and replaced it with the idea that we directly perceive objects without any intermediaries. 

## Arrow to [Bertrand_Russell] ("Objection")
Strawson disagrees with Russsell’s theory of description. Russell, in his On Denoting, argued that definite descriptions function as quantifier expressions. A sentence like “The F is G” should be analyzed in the following statement: 1. There is exist one and only one F, and 2. That F has the property G. For example, “The king of France is bald” implies that there exists a unique king of France and that he is bald. Although there is no referent by this sentence (there is no current king of France), this analysis keeps the sentence meaningful. 

However, Strawson argued that definite descriptions play a more nuanced role in ordinary language than Russell describes. The main points of his critique are:

1. Distinction between meaning and use
Strawson distinguishes between the meaning of an expression and the act of using it. He argues that sentences like “The King of France is bald” is not false when there is no referent. Instead, it is a so-called “truth-value gap”-- neither true nor false. For instance, if someone were to say this setentence today, a typical response would be confusions like “What do you mean? There is no king of France,” rather than simply taking the sentence as false.

2. Presupposition of Existence
Strawson suggests that using a definite description presupposes the existence of an object that fits the description, but such a presupposition does not entail the existence. When we say a sentence like “the car in the driveway,” we assume that the listener knows there is a specific car in the driveway without explicitly stating its existence. If no such car exists, the presupposition fails. And it leads to failure in communication instead of a false-valued statement. 

3. Reference and Communication
Strawson emphasized that the primary function of definite descriptions is to enable reference instead of to assert the existence of their referents. This difference is deeply rooted in the focus on how language is actually used in daily life. For example, when one says, “The book on the table is mine,” they expect the listener to identify the book they are referring to, rather than to treat it as a logical quantifier of a book’s existence.


## Arrow to [J.L._Austin] ("Objection")
J.L. Austin is a proponent of the correspondence theory of truth. According to this theory, a statement is true if it corresponds to a fact or state of affairs in the world. For instance, when someone says, "The television is broken," Austin's theory implies that the statement refers to a specific television and that it meets the descriptive conditions (i.e., being broken). The statement is true if the television matches this state.

Strawson critiqued Austin's theory on several points:

1. Truth and Linguistic Conventions
According to Strawson, truth is not about matching statements to external states through linguistic rules. Instead, he believed that when we claim something is true, we are performing a linguistic act that reflects agreement or endorsement, rather than stating a fact about the world.

2. Ontological Concerns
Strawson questions what Austin’s references really link sentences to. Are they linked to objects (e.g., the television) or to more abstract notions like facts or states of affairs? Strawson argues that facts and states of affairs should not be treated as things in the world that statements refer to. Instead, terms like "fact" are tools we use in our language to express the truth of statements, not new entities.


## Arrow to [W.V.O_Quine] ("Objection")

W.V.O. Quine challenges the analytic/synthetic distinction. He argued that there was no clear boundary between these two types of statements. Therefore, there is no so-called analyticity. To response, Strawson defended the analytic/synthetic distinction. While he acknowledged the complexities highlighted by Quine, he argued that the distinction still holds because of it usefulness in ordinary language use. In ordinary language, the difference between analytic and synthetic statements is not only meaningful but essential for communication. For instance, understanding the statement “All bachelors are unmarried” as analytically true helps convey its meaning without ambiguity. And in a broader context, the distinction is useful because people intuitively distinguish between truths that stem from meanings and those that rely on empirical facts.
