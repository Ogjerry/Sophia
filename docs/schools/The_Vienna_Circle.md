# The Vienna Circle
The Vienna Circle was a group of 20th-century philosophers who aimed to reformulate empiricism based on findings in physical and formal sciences. Their anti-metaphysical stance replaces synthetic a priori claims with a logicist approach to mathematics, taking philosophy as a meta-theoretical reflection on science. However, the Vienna Circle dissolved with the rise of Nazism in the mid of 1930s, as many members fled or were exiled. Despite this, their ideas continued to lead discussions on logic, philosophy of science, and math.

## Key doctrines
### Empiricism
Vienna Circle holds a restrictive empiricist definition of meaning: for a statement to be meaningful, it must be possible to verify it by observance, even if that verification is only theoretically possible. And this is a fierce opposition against the metaphysical tradition at that time, which was obsessed with handling entities that cannot be empirically verified. (e.g., the existence of God, the essence of soul) 

Coming along with Vienna Circle’s empiricist view, rejection of the notion of synthetic apriori knowledge is a key part of their theory. Synthetic a priori knowledge is discussed in Kantianism as certain knowledge (such as claims of space and time) that is both necessarily true and grounded in experience. In contrast, the Vienna Circle believed that so-called synthetic a priori knowledge is in fact subject to empirical testing and falsifiable. The Vienna Circle emphasized that knowledge must be either analytic apriori (logical or mathematical knowledge, such as 2 +2 =4) or synthetic a posteriori (empirical truth)

### The role of math and logic
For Vienna Circle, mathematics and logic are analytic. This means that mathematical and logical truths are true by definition, independent of observation. There is another name for such a kind of truth called tautology–it is true by its logical form rather than because it describes some facts. 

Following Wittgenstein’s view that logical truths do not tell information about the world but show the structure of language and thought, Vienna Circle argues that math and logic do not describe the facts about the world but provide a frame of empirical science. And this is the distinction between math/logic and natural sciences while the latter focuses on statements requiring empirical verification.

### Conventionalism
The essence of conventionalism is the belief that human knowledge—such as logic, mathematics, and even scientific theories—is not derived from objective truths about the world, but is instead constructed by human agreement or conventions. 

Applying this theory to logic and math, logical and mathematical truths are not truths about the world but truths that follow the rules and conventions of the system we use. 

Applying this understanding to science, Vienna Circle argues that scientific theories are not direct descriptions of the world but are tools we use to interpret our observations. This does not necessarily mean that science is arbitrary, but rather that science is chosen for its practical utility in explanation and prediction. An example can be that in the early 20th century, Einstein’s theory of relativity replaced Newton’s classical mechanics as the theory of motion and gravity. The Vienna Circle suggests that  Newton’s and Einstein’s theories were both valid within their respective contexts, but the replacement of one with the other depends on which set of conventions works better for explaining the observation.

Another side of Conventionalism is its pragmatic approach in choosing between two parallel theories. The Vienna Circle believes that the choice of a theory should be guided by practical considerations, such as simplicity, predictive power, and coherence with other established theories. This pragmatic approach allowed people to avoid metaphysical debates about the "true nature" of the world and instead focus on the practicality of different theories.

### Philosophy as Meta-theory
Vienna Circle makes the distinction between first-order and second-order disciplines: first-order disciplines are those that make claims about the world, including physics and biology, while second-order disciplines reflect on the structure and methods of first-order disciplines. Instead of a discipline that produces its own domain of knowledge, philosophy, according to Vienna Circle, is a second-order discipline. 

This understanding of philosophy aligns with the Circl’s rejection against metaphysics that asks questions like “what is the nature of being?” or “do moral norms exist independently of human minds?” Those metaphysical questions are deemed as meaningless because it fails the criteria for verification. (see the abvoce section c. Conventiaonlism) The role of philosophy, instead, is to examine the logical structure of scientific theories and their logical interconnections.

## Leading Figures
### Moritz Schlick
Moritz Schlick played a crucial role in the critique of metaphysics and defining philosophy as the problem of language clarification.  He argued that traditional metaphysical debates—about the nature of reality, the existence of free will, the nature of God, or the immortality of the soul—were meaningless because they could not be subjected to empirical verification. According to Schlick, such debates stem from misunderstandings about language and the improper use of terms.

### Otto Neurath
Neurath’s work focused on the social and practical dimension of science, with the emphasis on the importance of communication in developing scientific theories. Neurath saw science as an inherently social and cooperative work. He believed that science was not just about creating logically perfect systems but about problem-solving in the real world. Essentially speaking, scientific theories are tools that humans use to explore the world and solve practical problems, rather than abstract systems seeking to perfectly represent reality. 
Since science is highly context-sensitive, scientific theories are fundamentally incomplete and revisable. And that is why scientists should always work together, exchanging knowledge and methods to continuously improve the understanding of the world.

The integration of natural sciences with social sciences is another key part of Neurath’s work. He argues that both should be grounded in empirical observance and that there should be no fundamental differences in their methodologies. And this is a part of unity of science idea within the Vienna Circle in general.

A prominent contribution by Neurath is his boat metaphor: scientific knowledge is a boat being repaired at sea. Scientist cannot step outside of their current knowledge to find a firm foundation. Instead, they must repair and improve the boat while still using it. This metaphor indicates that scientific inquiry is essentially continuous and revisable and that there is no absolute starting point for knowledge. This metaphor also captures the holistic feature of scientific theory: scientific theories cannot be tested or evaluated in isolation. Instead, they must be understood in the context of the entire body of scientific knowledge. When a scientific theory is called into question, it is not just the individual hypothesis under examination but the entire network of theories and methods that support it.


## Arrow to [Rudolf Carnap] ("Divergence")
Neurath’s pragmatic philosophy of science is in contrast to the more formal and logic-focused approach of his colleague Rudolf Carnap. While Carnap is focused on formalizing the logical structure of scientific language, Neurath is more concerned with the practical application of science.

Neurath believed that Carnap’s focus on logical precision could sometimes be detached from the realities of scientific practice. He argued that science essentially requires collaboration and that theories should be evaluated based on their practical success, not just on their logical structure. This led Neurath to adopt a more flexible and holistic view of scientific language than Carnap’s more rigid, formalist approach.
