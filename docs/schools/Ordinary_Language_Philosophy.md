# Ordinary Language Philosophy

Ordinary Language Philosophy is a branch that underlines the importance of analyzing the way language is used in order to clarify philosophical problems. This is different from philosophy of language since ordinary language philosophy is not just focused on language structure and meaning but instead on practical everyday use. The central claim for ordinary language philosophy is that many philosophical problems arise when words are taken out of their usual context and analyzed in a non-ordinary way.

Ordinary Language philosophy emphasizes that language is not just a tool for expressing thought but is central to philosophy itself. The philosophers of this school believed that by closely analyzing the use of words and phrases in everyday conversation, one could dissolve philosophical problems rather than solve them through complex theories. 

## Ordinary and non-ordinary Uses of language

Ordinary Language philosophers made a distinction between ordinary and non-ordinary uses of language. **Ordinary use** are cases of words used in everyday discourse, which is often implicit and follows shared common-sense rules. Non-ordinary use, on the other hand, is cases when words are used in ways that are different from their typical context or when terms are reinterpreted in a special way.

For example, the word "know" in ordinary use could express daily certainties, like "I know the sun will rise tomorrow." However, in a philosophical context, the word can be interpreted in a highly technical sense, such as "I cannot know for sure if the external world exists." Ordinary Language philosophers argued that many philosophical confusions are rooted in treating non-ordinary uses as though they were interchangeable with ordinary ones. In such cases of confusion, philosophers inadvertently generate paradoxes that did not exist when the terms were used in their ordinary context.

## Dissolving Metaphysical Problems

Many ordinary language philosophers believe that many metaphysical problems are not genuine problems but are instead rooted in linguistic confusion. For instance, asking the question “what is time” treats time as an object with tractable essence. But this is not a good assumption of time. Instead, to answer this question, we need to look at how "time" is discussed in normal conversation – as a measure, a sequence, or an experience, instead of an object.

## Arrow to  [Vienna_Circle] ("Objection")

Ordinary Language philosophy emerged in the early 20th century. And it was significantly shaped by reactions against the rigid and formal approaches by Logical Atomism. Many members in Vienna Circle and such as Rudolph Carnap, aimed to build an ‘ideal’ language that could perfectly represent reality through strict logical structure. They considered natural language to be flawed and ambiguous.

In contrast, proponents of Ordinary Language philosophy argued that everyday language is sufficient to express reality. Rather than seeing ordinary language as an obstacle that needed refinement, they argue that philosophical clarity could be achieved by carefully attending to how words are typically used in common discourse. This approach was seen as more grounded, dealing with how people actually communicate and make sense of the world.
