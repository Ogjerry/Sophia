# Logical Empricism

## Overview and History

Logical empiricism is best understood as a philosophical movement instead of a doctrine. So it was not based on a single unified set of principles that all supporters follow. Instead, it is an intellectual trend of discussions on science, logic, and empirical methods in philosophy. The key of logical empiricism is its strong emphasis on scientific methodology, examining the principles and techniques implemented in scientific investigation.

The logical empiricist movement started in Europe during the 1920s and 1930s, particularly through influential groups such as the Vienna Circle and the Berlin Society for Empirical Philosophy. These groups looked at modern scientific advancement and aimed to formulate a philosophy that could explain and direct scientific exploration. Particularly, they aimed to build philosophy theories with true explanatory power, in contrast with metaphysical frameworks, which seemed as detached from realities.

In the 1940s, a number of philosophers in the logical empiricist movement moved to the United States, due to the political and cultural upheaval in Europe. Upon their arrival, those philosophers involved in logical empiricism had a profound influence within American academia. Notable philosophers such as Rudolf Carnap, Hans Reichenbach, and Herbert Feigl played significant roles in major U.S. universities. And logical empiricism further developed and began to engage with American philosophical traditions, including pragmatism.

## Key issues explored by logical empiricism

### Verificationism

Verificationism asserts that ##a statement is meaningful if and only if it is empirically verifiable or is analytically true. For a statement to be empirically verifiable, there must be a possible way to test its truth or falsity with observable data. For example, a statement “water boils at 100 celsius degree at sea level” can be tested by experiment. 

### Analyticity and Mathematics

Logical empiricism particularly emphasizes the importance of math and logic as they are the foundation for science. Mathematical and logical truth are analytic instead of synthetic. The distinction is that the truth of analytic statements is determined by definition while the truth of synthetic statements depends on how the actual world is. For instance, “2+2 = 4” is analytic as it is true by the definition of arithmetic.  On the other hand, a statement such as “sky is blue” is synthetic since it needs observance to make conclusion on its truth.

Because of its analytical nature, math and logic provide a reliable foundation for science. Combined with accurate observance, we can come up with solid scientific theories. And for the same reason, philosophy should be more rigorous and precise by applying logic and mathematics.

### Unity of Science

Unity of science is the idea that all branches of science- both natural science like physics and social science like sociology– are interconnected and essentially parts of a single coherent framework.

The background of this idea at the time was the aim to develop a common scientific language where concepts and terms used in one discipline could be translated and used in others. And this stems from a deeper metaphysical commitment called physicalism, which suggests that all sciences are ultimately reducible to physics.
