## Language and Philosophy [ontology] [philosophy_of_language]

Austin is a supporter of ordinary language philosophy by believing that philosophical problems stem from misunderstanding of how language is used in daily life. As many other supporters of ordinary language philosophy, Austin advocates for a close exmaniantion of how people use ordinary language in everyday life instead of inventing technical jargons or analysing abstract theoretical freamworks. 

Another aspect of the relation between language and philosophy, proposed by Austin, is that the study of language is a necessary step before tackling broader philosophical questions. And misunderstanding language would create unnecessary philosophical confusions. To clarify the understanding of language, Austin proposes a methodology involving following steps: 

1. Usage Analysis. The clarification begins by exmamining how terms and phrases are used in daily life. For example, what do people usually mean when they say “I know”?

2. Divergence Recognition. Then, we look for points where philosophical usage is different from ordinary usage. This process helps to identify areas where theoretical abstraction becomes misleading.

3. Philosophical Issuess Reassessing. Lastly, reflect on philosophical problems with a better understanding of lagnague in ordinary usage. 

## Language and Truth [epistemology] [phil_of_language]

Austin emphasizes that “truth” is not merely about endorsing a statement but is a **descriptive function**. Specifically, saying something is “true” is describing a relationship between the statement and the fact it refers to. To clarify the role of statements, Austin makes the distinction between **descriptive conventions** and **demonstrative conventions**. By descriptive conventions, these conventions establish the general types of facts in the world. For instance, “the cat is on the mat” describes a type of situation where a cat is positioned on a mat. On the other hand, demonstrative conventions specify how specific instances are organized on a particular occasion. For instance, when someone says “The cat is on the mat,” they point to a specific cat on a mat in a particular context where their discussion is particular instead of general.

By emphasizing the context, intent, and purpose of language, Austin rejects the binary understanding of statement as either true or false. For example, in a schoolbook for general geography, the statement “France is hexagonal” can be true because it provides a practical, though simplified, description for a pedagogical purpose. However, in a serious geographic research paper, the same statement can be false because it is oversimplifed. The reason for this difference, as Austin highlights, is that the truth value is purpose-sensitive. That is to say that the truth of statements depends on the intentions and context behind the statement and audience’s expectations.

## Knowledge and perception [epistemology]

### Austin’s Knowledge Theory

Austin defines knowledge as a kind of guarantee about its content. It is well shown in Austin’s statement “If you know, you can’t be wrong.” In contrast, belief, though involving subjective conviction, lacks the guarantee of truth. 

In alignment with his emphasis on context, Austin proposes that knowledge is practical and context-dependent. Statements like “I know the road is icy” are meaningful only when they contribute to actionsor decision.

Another renovating aspect of Austin’s knowledge theory is his critique of foundationalism. By foundatioanlism, it is absolutely sure for one’s subjective claims, such as their own thoughts, feelings, or sensory experiences. For example, it is undoubtedly sure for me that “I see color blue or not.” And statements about the external world, on the other hand, are more insecure as they are derived from subjective statements.

Austin, instead, argues against foundationalism by proposing that no judgment, even about one’s own experience, is entirely sure. For example, one can misinterpret their sensory inputs. And judgments about the external world can often be as secure as those about subjective experiences. 

### Perceptions

Austin opposes the sense-data theory of perception, which suggest that we primarily perceive sense-data. (the internal representations of the world) Instead, Austin advocates for an idea called direct realism that our perception interact directly with the external world. The common response from sense-data theory side is the argument from illusion, which suggests that perception must be indirect because illusions or hallucinations happen. Austin’s response is built on the following two points: 

1. Illusions are contextual. Illusions only occur in specific conditions. And illusions do not undermine the general credibility of perceptions. For instance, a bent appearance of a stick in water does not negate the fact that the stick is straight outside of water.

2. Peceptions are not passive. Our perception is under interpretation and judgment. That means illusions are essentially misinterpretations of our experience. And this does not prove that perception is inherently idirect. Instead this shows tha fallibility of our judgment.
