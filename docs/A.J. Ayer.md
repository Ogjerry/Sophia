## I. Meaning and Knowledge [Epistemology] [Philosophy_of_Language]
### The Verification Principle
The verification principle states that a statement is meaningful if and only if it can be verified. Verification, in this sense, is the process of confirming a statement through observation or experience. By this principle, propositions are classified into three categories:

Analytic Propositions: Statements true by definition, like mathematical or logical truths. (such as  “All bachelors are unmarried”)
Synthetic Propositions: Statements verifiable through experience, like “The cat is on the mat.”
Meaningless Statements: These are neither analytic nor empirically verifiable. Metaphysical claims, like “The Absolute is Infinite,” fall into this category, as they cannot be tested by experience.

In this way, metaphysical claims become meaningless, as they are not verifiable.
To clarify what verification means in different contexts, Ayer distinguishes between strong and weak verification. **Strongly verifiable** statements are those that can be conclusively proven, while **weakly verifiable** statements can be supported by potential or indirect evidence, even if only in principle. This clarification of weak verification creates room for many scientific statements. For instance, a statement like “There are planets beyond our observable universe” is meaningful under weak verification. This is because we can infer indirect support from our observations of planets within the observable universe, even if we cannot directly observe planets beyond it.

### Theory of Knowledge
Ayer’s theory of knowledge defines knowledge as:

1. Belief in a statement
2. The statement is true, and
3. The person has “the right to be sure” about the statement

In Ayer’s view, knowledge depends on having sufficient justification according to the standards in the context. And the context is the source of “the right to be sure.” In this sense, Ayer emphasizes a definition of knowledge based on evidence that is good enough for practical purposes, even if it does not meet a strict or infallible certainty.
“The right to be sure” in Ayer’s definition of knowledge highlights the context-sensitive feature of justification. Indeed, justification can take place differently in different contexts: in different domains—such as mathematics, science, or everyday life—the level of evidence required to justify a belief varies: In mathematics, one must provide formal proof to justify a knowledge claim. In science, justification often comes from empirical evidence, which is open to change and refinement. So, scientific knowledge doesn’t require absolute certainty, just strong, empirically grounded support. And in everyday context, even less strict evidence is sufficient for knowledge.

## Perception [Philosophy_of_Mind]
There is a shift in Ayer’s theory on perception. In a nutshell, Ayer shifted from Phenomenalism, which he adopted in his early works, to Realism. We will this shift chronologically in following paragraphs.
### Ayer’s Initial Commitment to Phenomenalism
Phenomenalism suggests that our statements about physical objects can be translated into statements about sensory experiences. (or so-called “sense data”) According to phenomenalism, what we call “physical objects” are essentially collections of sensory experiences. So what we call “a chair” is a collection of possible sensory experiences that we might have. Interestingly, phenomenalism aligns with Ayer’s verification principle by ensuring that physical object statements are meaningful because they are grounded in observable sensory experiences. 

However, Ayer recognized certain challenges in phenomenalism, especially its view of the reduction of statements about physical objects to sensory experiences. In particular, physical objects are more than a collection of sensory experiences: they also imply stability, continuity, and a kind of objectivity that sense data alone cannot fully account for.

### Shift to Sophisticated Realism
Given the limits, Ayer moved toward the so-called sophisticated realism. Such a position argues that besides sense data, our perception of physical objects also involves an interpretive framework or theoretical structure. Imagine you are sitting in a room and see a cup on a table in front of you. You directly experience certain sense data: the shape of the cup, its color, and shadow, etc. When you leave the room, you no longer see the cup. However, you continue to believe it exits on the table. Such a belief is not derived from continuous sense data from the cup but from your interpretive framework. An interpretive framework makes the inference that physical objects continue to exist even when unobserved.
According to Ayer, this interpretive framework is important because it enables us to organize and make sense of sensory data as representing stable physical objects. In this sense, physical objects are therefore a part of a “secondary system” that we impose on our raw sense data. Without this interpretive framework, our sensory experiences would lack coherence, and we would not be able to speak meaningfully about a consistent, objective reality.

### Illusion and Indirect Perception
Besides the limit of phenomenalism, another motive for Ayer’s shift to realism is the argument from illusion. The argument suggests that our perception must involve mental representations rather than direct access to the external world since we can experience illusions where our perception does not match reality. For instance, a stick appears bent in water, but it does not mean that the stick is actually bent. Instead, it is an illusion in our perception.
Based on this argument from illusion, Ayer argues that our perceptions are essentially interpretations of sensory experiences, not direct experiences of physical objects. Since our sensory experiences are sometimes misleading, our perception is indirect. In this story of perception, sense data serve as intermediaries between our mind and the external world.

## Ethics
### Emotivism and the Rejection of Moral Facts
Ayer’s standpoint on ethical theory is known as emotivism. Emotivism argues that moral statements do not express factual information. Instead, they are expressions of the speaker’s emotions or attitudes toward a particular issue. For instance, saying “Murder is wrong” is not a statement about the moral value of murdering but an expression of the speaker’s disapproval against murder, for emotivism. 

As observed, emotivism makes no room for moral facts. And this aligns with Ayer’s verification principle which stipulates that ethical statements are meaningless because they are not empirically verifiable. 

In addition to emotional expression, according to Ayer, ethical statements also play a prescriptive role. That is to say, ethical statements also can be seen as encouraging other to adopt similar attitudes

### Distinction between emotivism and Subjectivism
Ayer distinguishes emotivism from subjectivism. Subjectivism suggests that moral statements describe the speaker’s feelings. In this sense, descriptions of feelings contain truth value– it can be true or false. For example, if someone says “Murder is wrong,” subjectivists would take it as an equivalent way of saying “I disapprove of murder.” This is a statement about their own feelings, and it can be true or false– depending on whether the statement accurately reflects the speaker’s feelings. Meanwhile, for emotivists, if someone says “Murder is wrong,” it is equivalent to saying “Boo to murder!” as a mere emotional expression. In this case, the statement does not express anything factual and thus does not have any truth value.
